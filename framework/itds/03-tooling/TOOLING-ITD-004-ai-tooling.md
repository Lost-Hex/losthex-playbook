# TOOLING-ITD-004: AI Tooling

## CONTEXT

Multiple AI tools exist for documentation: Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Teams have preferences. Mandating a single tool creates friction.

## PROBLEM

Should we mandate specific AI tools for documentation?

## OPTIONS CONSIDERED

1. **Mandate Cursor + Claude** - Standardize on what works
2. ✅ **No mandate, document what works** - Share recommendations, allow flexibility
3. **Ban AI tools** - Ensure "authentic" human writing

## REASONING

*Option 1 (Mandate):* Creates friction for team members with different preferences. Tools evolve fast—today's best choice may not be tomorrow's.

*Option 2 (Document what works):* Share what the framework authors use (Cursor + Claude) as a reference. Let teams choose. Outcomes matter, not tools.

*Option 3 (Ban):* Absurd. We're an AI-forward company.

## IMPLICATIONS

- No required AI tooling
- Reference setup documented: Cursor IDE + Claude for iteration
- Teams free to use alternatives (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- Focus on output quality, not tool choice

**Current recommendation (January 2026):** Claude Opus 4.5 is the preferred model for spec work—significantly better reasoning and technical depth than alternatives. This will change; update this ITD when it does.
