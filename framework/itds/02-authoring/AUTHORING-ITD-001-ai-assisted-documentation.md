# AUTHORING-ITD-001: AI-Assisted Documentation

## CONTEXT

LostHex uses AI tools (Cursor, Claude) throughout the development process. Documentation is no exception—AI can draft specs, structure ITDs, and iterate on feedback faster than manual writing.

**The Question:** Should we formally encourage AI assistance in documentation, or keep it informal?

## PROBLEM

How should teams use AI tools when writing specs and ITDs?

## OPTIONS CONSIDERED

1. **Discourage AI** - Require human-written documentation for authenticity
2. ✅ **Encourage AI with human accountability** - Use AI freely, but humans own the output
3. **Mandate AI** - Require AI drafts for all documentation

## REASONING

*Option 1 (Discourage):* Slower, no real benefit. "Authenticity" doesn't matter if the content is accurate and well-reasoned.

*Option 2 (Encourage with accountability):* AI accelerates drafting and iteration. Humans verify accuracy, ensure reasoning reflects reality, and take responsibility for claims. Best of both worlds.

*Option 3 (Mandate):* Too rigid. Sometimes quick notes or small edits don't need AI. Forcing it adds friction.

## IMPLICATIONS

- Authors may use AI tools freely for drafting, structuring, and iterating
- Authors remain accountable for all content—"the AI wrote it" is not a defense
- Reviewers evaluate the document, not the tools authors used
- No disclosure requirement for AI usage
